        Revan was a Jedi Knight and General during the Mandalorian Wars. A Human male once known by the nickname the Revanchist, he was both a charismatic and enigmatic leader, a renowned tactician and expert strategist, and a hero of the Galactic Republic during the Mandalorian Wars, leading the Republic fleets to victory after victory. Ending the conflict personally, with the execution of Mandalore the Ultimate and the destruction of Malachor V, Revan led the remains of the Republic fleet deep into the Unknown Regions to hunt down the remaining Mandalorians. He returned however, as Darth Revan, the Dark Lord of the Sith.

        Deploying his vast armada, the very ships that had fought alongside him during the Mandalorian Wars, against the Republic fleet, Revan ignited the Jedi Civil War. Revan and his Sith apprentice Darth Malak claimed repeated victories against the Republic, and in the process established a powerful new Sith Empire. For two and a half years Revan's fleet cut a swath of destruction through the Republic before the Dark Lord was finally betrayed by Darth Malak, and captured by the Jedi Order.

        Thought dead to the entire galaxy, Revan survived, through the efforts of Bastila Shan, although his mind was severely damaged. Unable to restore the Dark Lord's memories, the Jedi Council repaired what they could of his damaged mind, programming a new identity into Revan, one loyal to the Republic. In the year that followed, Revan and a company of followers searched the galaxy for the source of Malak's vast fleet. Despite eventually learning of his previous identity, Revan rejected the evil of his past, defeated Malak and ended the very war he had begun.

        A year later, Revan once again departed for the Unknown Regions. A former Jedi Master of Revan's, Kreia, believed that Darth Revan's brutally efficient invasion of the galaxy had been part of a complex plan to secure the Republic from a long-hidden unknown threat and suggested that Revan had departed on a solitary quest to defeat it once and for all.

Revan turned to the Dark side after discovering the location of the Star Forge, a collossal construct built by an anchient race lost race. Revan and Malak used the Star Forge to create a gigantic army bent on conqeuring the galaxy. Half way through the war, Malak betrayed Revan during a Jedi assault attack. Revan left for dead by Malak, Bastila Shan brought Revan back to the Jedi Council on Dantooine. They wiped his memory of being the Dark Lord and created a new idenity in which he served the Republic. However Revan regains his memory and defeats Malak and detroys the Star Forge. However, he later disappeared after the war and was never seen again. Some had said he traveled to the far reaches of the Outer Rim, but no one knew for sure."
